"# langDec – Language Learning Software (Prototype)

## Overview
A language learning application based on the **Birkenbihl decoding method**, enabling learners to process texts through word-by-word translation alongside traditional contextual translation. The software combines reading, listening, and active vocabulary work to facilitate effective language acquisition.

## Key Features

### 🔤 Dual Translation Modes
- **Contextual Translation**: Natural, fluent translations
- **Decoded Translation**: 1:1 word-for-word translation preserving original word order for structural transparency

### 📚 Text Management
- Copy & paste text input
- OCR support for images and PDFs
- Folder-based organization with metadata
- Local storage

### 🔊 Audio & Listening
- Text-to-Speech in original and translated languages
- Adjustable playback speed
- Playlist creation and management
- MP3 export for external players

### 📖 Vocabulary Trainer
- Flashcard-based learning system
- Multiple learning boxes (spaced repetition)
- Quick word lookup and card creation
- CSV import/export

## Supported Languages (Initial Phase)
- German (native language)
- English
- Portuguese

The architecture is **language-agnostic** and designed for easy expansion to additional languages.

## Target Audience
- Adult self-learners
- Language enthusiasts
- Users of the Birkenbihl method
- Autodidacts focused on reading & listening

## Technical Approach
- Modular architecture (translation, audio, vocabulary as separate components)
- Platform-independent design
- Focus on learning usability over perfect AI translation
- Extensible for future desktop/web/mobile implementations
